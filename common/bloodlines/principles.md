I believe in two core principles for the bloodlines:

- Bloodlines shouldn't be straight up advantages, introducing more of them should not upset the balance of power too much.
- New bloodlines that make the game more interesting to play shouldn't be hard to add.

From that, they'll be designed around the following:

- Bloodlines should give group-targeted opinion boosts, but also group-targeted opinion penalties, and those affecting larger/more groups.
- Bloodlines shouldn't ever give attribute boosts or penalties, but they can give combat rating boosts and make changes to more specialised stats like plot power or global revolt chances.
- Bloodlines should be mostly about options rather than straight up vertical upgrades, so stuff like "attracting the service of knights" or whatever is nice or "access to x decision" as well; ties into the previous thing too.
- A way to purge a bloodline from yourself (AKA renounce your heritage) is necessary, considering they're not straight advantages. However, this should involve some requirements beyond clicking a button and paying some resources (unless it really is a lot resources) - if you want to stop being associated with your grandfather Link you can't really be a brave virtuous person when you renounce him, nobody'd believe you anyway.
- Stacking bloodlines should have a drawback that isn't just "you suck" but something interesting; having events that can happen only to those with a lot of bloodlines is a good way to do it. Examples include being challenged to duels by other members of the bloodline (who want to prove that they'll be the better descendant of link than you'll ever be; perhaps temporarily disabling your part of the bloodline when they win as bloodlines are supposed to be about perception) or being beset by assassins who want to make a point (though that part shouldn't be very lethal for obvious reasons).

That last part in particular is handled by adding one of three flags to every bloodline - major_notoriety, moderate_notoriety or minor_notoriety and having events base off the amount of those the character has. Those events are mostly generic, but some bloodlines might still have unique stuff in addition to them.

Remember that those are guidelines, not hard rules; but whenever you even think about breaking guidelines, first think what goal you're achieving by doing that.
